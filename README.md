An exercise, in which I practiced:
- using React Components, 
- adding re-usable components, 
- managing the user input state, 
- adding a list component, 
- managing a list of users via 'state', 
- adding an error modal component.

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
